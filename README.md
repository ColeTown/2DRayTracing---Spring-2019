# 2DRayTracing---Spring-2019

This was a small project I did back in high school that is basically a rip off of the original doom engine and similar games from that era. In the source code I have several walls initialized and several rays cast out in a 2 dimensional plane. The distance from the perspective point to the wall is interpreted on screen to simulate a crude 3-Dimensional render of the 2-Dimensional map.
